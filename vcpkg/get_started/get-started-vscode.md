# Tutorial: Install and use packages with CMake in Visual Studio Code

This tutorial shows you how to create a C++ "Hello World" program that uses the
`fmt` library with CMake, vcpkg and Visual Studio Code. You'll install
dependencies, configure, build, and run a simple application.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com>)
- [C++ compiler](<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_install-a-compiler>)
- Windows 7 or newer
- [Git](<https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
- [Ninja](<https://ninja-build.org/>)

## 1 - Set up vcpkg

[!INCLUDE [setup-vcpkg](includes/setup-vcpkg.md)]

## 2 - Create a project folder

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're running this tutorial in Windows and using MSVC as your compiler
  > you need to start the Visual Studio Code instance from a Developer Command
  > Prompt for VS or Developer PowerShell for VS. This ensures that the compiler
  > path and other environment variables are correctly set up.

  Create a folder to hold the project files in a location of your choice. For
  this tutorial, we create a folder named "helloworld". Then open the folder
  using Visual Studio Code.

  ```
  mkdir helloworld
  code helloworld
  ```

## 3 - Install Visual Studio Code Extensions

  Navigate to the Extension view, and install the [C++
  Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools).
  This enables C++ IntelliSense and code navigation.

  Install the [CMake Tools
  Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools).
  This enables CMake support in Visual Studio Code.

## 4 - Set up environment variables

1. Configure the `VCPKG_ROOT` environmental variable.

  Open a new Terminal in Visual Studio Code: **Terminal > New Terminal**

  Run the following commands:
  ::: zone pivot="shell-powershell"
  
  [!INCLUDE [env-vars](../../includes/env-vars.md)]

  ```PowerShell
  $env:VCPKG_ROOT="C:\path\to\vcpkg"
  $env:PATH="$env:VCPKG_ROOT;$env:PATH"
  ```

  :::image type="complex" source="../resources/get_started/vscode-terminal-vcpkg.png" alt-text="setting up vcpkg environment variables":::

  :::image-end:::

  [!INCLUDE [env-vars](../../includes/env-vars.md)]

  ::: zone-end
  ::: zone pivot="shell-cmd"

  [!INCLUDE [env-vars](../../includes/env-vars.md)]

  ```console
  set "VCPKG_ROOT=C:\path\to\vcpkg"
  set PATH=%VCPKG_ROOT%;%PATH%
  ```
  ::: zone-end
  ::: zone pivot="shell-bash"

  [!INCLUDE [env-vars](../../includes/env-vars-bash.md)]

  ```bash
  export VCPKG_ROOT=/c/path/to/vcpkg
  export PATH=$PATH:$VCPKG_ROOT
  ```

  ::: zone-end

  Setting `VCPKG_ROOT` helps Visual Studio Code locate your vcpkg instance.
  Adding it to `PATH` ensures you can run vcpkg commands directly from the
  shell.

2. Generate a manifest file and add dependencies.

  Run the following command to create a vcpkg manifest file (`vcpkg.json`) in
  the root of the `helloworld` folder:

  ```console
  vcpkg new --application
  ```

  The [`vcpkg new`](../commands/new.md) command adds a `vcpkg.json` file and a
  `vcpkg-configuration.json` file in the project's directory.

  Add the `fmt` package as a dependency:

  ```console
  vcpkg add port fmt
  ```

  Your `vcpkg.json` should now contain:

  ```json
  {
    "dependencies": [
      "fmt"
    ]
  }
  ```

  This is your manifest file. vcpkg reads the manifest file to learn what
  dependencies to install and integrates with CMake to provide the
  dependencies required by your project.

  The generated `vcpkg-configuration.json` file introduces a
  [baseline](../reference/vcpkg-configuration-json.md#registry-baseline) that
  places [minimum version constraints](../users/versioning.md) on the project's
  dependencies. Modifying this file is beyond the scope of this tutorial. While
  not applicable in this tutorial, it's a good practice to keep the
  `vcpkg-configuration.json` file under source control to ensure version
  consistency across different development environments.

## 5 - Set up the project files

1. Create the `CMakeLists.txt` file

  Create a new file named `CMakeLists.txt` in the root of the project folder with the following content:

  :::code language="cmake" source="../examples/snippets/get-started/CMakeLists.txt"::: 

  Let's break down what each line in the `CMakeLists.txt` file:
    
  - `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)`: Specifies that the minimum version
    of CMake required to build the project is 3.10. If the version of CMake
    installed on your system is lower than this, an error will be generated.
  - `project(HelloWorld)`: Sets the name of the project to "HelloWorld."
  - `find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)`: Looks for the `fmt` library using its
    CMake configuration file. The `REQUIRED` keyword ensures that an error is
    generated if the package is not found. 
  - `add_executable(HelloWorld helloworld.cpp)`: Adds an executable target named
    "HelloWorld," built from the source file `helloworld.cpp`.
  - `target_link_libraries(HelloWorld PRIVATE fmt::fmt)`: Specifies that the
    `HelloWorld` executable should link against the `fmt` library. The `PRIVATE`
    keyword indicates that `fmt` is only needed for building `HelloWorld` and
    should not propagate to other dependent projects. 

2. Create the `helloworld.cpp` file with the following content:

  :::code language="cpp" source="../examples/snippets/get-started/helloworld.cpp":::

  In this `helloworld.cpp` file, the `<fmt/core.h>` header is included for using
  the `fmt` library. The `main()` function then calls `fmt::print()` to output
  the "Hello World!" message to the console.

  To allow the CMake project system to recognize C++ libraries provided by
  vcpkg, you'll need to provide the `vcpkg.cmake` toolchain file. To automate
  this, create a `CMakePresets.json` file in the "helloworld" directory with the
  following content:

  :::code language="json" source="../examples/snippets/get-started/CMakePresets.json":::

3. Create `CMakeUserPresets.json` file in the "helloworld" directory with the
following content:

  :::code language="json" source="../examples/snippets/get-started/CMakeUserPresets.json":::

  This `CMakePresets.json` file contains a single "vcpkg" preset for CMake and
  sets the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable. The `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` allows
  the CMake project system to recognize C++ libraries provided by vcpkg. Only
  `CMakePresets.json` is meant to be checked into source control while
  `CMakeUserPresets.json` is to be used locally.

## 6 - Build and run the project

1. Run the `CMake: Build` command the project by navigating to the Command Palette in **View > Command Palette**

  :::image type="complex" source="../resources/get_started/vscode-command-build.png" alt-text="CMake build command in Visual Studio Code":::

  :::image-end:::

  Select the `default` CMake preset. This enables the vcpkg toolchain.

2. Launch the project

  Run the program:

  :::zone pivot="shell-powershell,shell-cmd"
  ```bash
  ./build/HelloWorld.exe
  ```
  :::zone-end
  :::zone pivot="shell-bash"
  ```bash
  ./build/HelloWorld
  ```
  :::zone-end

  You should see the output:

  ```Console
  Hello World!
  ```
